There are two ways to use [ellmer chat
models](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) for batch
processing. This flexibility allows you to 1) pass a chat model object
or 2) pass a function. The chat object method is more flexible because
the object can be reused.

## Method 1: Passing an Object

The first method is to pass a chat model object. This is useful when you
want to reuse an existing model configuration:

``` r
library(hellmer)

claude <- chat_claude(
  model = "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
  system_prompt = "Reply concisely",
  echo = "none",
  max_tokens = 1000
)

chat <- chat_sequential(claude)
```

## Method 2: Passing a Function

The second method is to pass an ellmer chat model function directly.
This method may be preferred if you only need to use a model once or
aesthetically prefer not to nest functions. There is not much reason to
use this method, but it is available for backward compatibility.

``` r
chat <- chat_sequential(chat_claude, system_prompt = "Reply concisely")
```
