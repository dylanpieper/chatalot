}
\arguments{
\item{chat_model}{Chat model function/object (default: \code{ellmer::chat_claude})}

\item{echo}{Level of output to display: "none" for silent operation,
"text" for response text only, or "all" for full interaction (default: "none")}

\item{beep}{Logical to play a sound on batch completion, interruption, and error (default: TRUE)}

\item{max_retries}{Maximum number of retry attempts per prompt (default: 3L)}

\item{initial_delay}{Initial delay in seconds before first retry (default: 20)}

\item{max_delay}{Maximum delay in seconds between retries (default: 60)}

\item{backoff_factor}{Factor to multiply delay by after each retry (default: 2)}

\item{timeout}{Maximum time in seconds to wait for each prompt response (default: 60)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying chat model}
}
\value{
A batch results object containing:
\itemize{
\item prompts: Original input prompts
\item responses: Raw response data for completed prompts
\item completed: Number of successfully processed prompts
\item state_path: Path where batch state is saved
\item type_spec: Type specification used for structured data
\item texts: Function to extract text responses
\item chats: Function to extract chat objects
\item progress: Function to get processing status
\item structured_data: Function to extract structured data (if \code{type_spec} was provided)
}
}
\description{
Processes a batch of chat prompts one at a time in sequential order.
Maintains state between runs and can resume interrupted processing.
For parallel processing, use \code{chat_future()}.
