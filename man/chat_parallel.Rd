\arguments{
\item{chat_model}{A chat model object}

\item{workers}{Number of parallel workers to use}

\item{plan}{Processing strategy to use: "multisession" for separate R sessions
or "multicore" for forked processes}

\item{beep}{Logical indicating whether to play sound on completion}

\item{timeout}{Maximum time in seconds to wait for each prompt response}

\item{max_chunk_attempts}{Maximum number of retry attempts for failed chunks (default: 3)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the chat model}

\item{chat_obj}{Chat model object for making API calls}

\item{prompts}{Vector or list of prompts to process}

\item{type_spec}{Type specification for structured data extraction}

\item{state_path}{Path to save intermediate state}

\item{chunk_size}{Number of prompts to process per chunk}
}
\value{
Batch results object

A batch results object containing:
\itemize{
\item prompts: Original input prompts
\item responses: Raw response data for completed prompts
\item completed: Number of successfully processed prompts
\item state_path: Path where batch state is saved
\item type_spec: Type specification used for structured data
\item texts(): Function to extract text responses
\item chats(): Function to extract chat objects
\item progress(): Function to get processing status
\item structured_data(): Function to extract structured data if type_spec was provided
}
}
\description{
Processes a batch of chat prompts using parallel workers.
Splits prompts into chunks for processing while maintaining state.
For sequential processing, use \code{chat_batch()}.
