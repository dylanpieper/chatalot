## Submission notes

Resubmission notes (no response from original submission on 07/28/2025):
* Fixed CRAN badge link from hellmer to chatalot
* Provided better guidance for package installation using pak
* Improved internal functionality related to persistent caching

Original submission notes:
* This submission renames the package from hellmer to chatalot with prior approval from CRAN maintainers (Kurt Hornik, 07/09/2025). The new name better reflects the package's functionality for processing LLM chat conversations.
* Following CRAN's guidance, I request archival of the hellmer package after chatalot is published, with a reminder to add the "Replaced-by: override" to the repository database. No packages depend on hellmer.
