## Submission notes
This submission renames the package from "hellmer" to "chatalot" with prior approval from CRAN maintainers (Kurt Hornik, 07/09/2025). The new name better reflects the package's functionality for processing LLM chat conversations.

Following CRAN's guidance, I will request archival of the "hellmer" package after "chatalot" is published, with a reminder to add the "Replaced-by: override" to the repository database. No packages depend on "hellmer".
